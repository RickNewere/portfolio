                <h3>DevOps / Platform Cloud Engineer · Cost & Resources Manager</h3>
                <p>
                    As a DevOps and Platform Cloud Engineer, I manage requests from a wide range of stakeholders and
                    handle
                    infrastructure issues across major cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. My daily work involves
                    ensuring
                    that DevOps pipelines align with established standards, coordinating production releases across
                    multiple teams,
                    and implementing a maintenance strategy aimed at reducing incident tickets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I lead the industrialization of internal operations by training and onboarding new DevOps engineers
                    and
                    ensuring they're aligned with company practices. I also manage the operational budget for all cloud
                    resources,
                    continuously monitoring costs and reallocating them appropriately across teams and countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2024, I successfully implemented cost optimization strategies that led to savings of over
                    €500,000 across
                    all accounts. Additionally, I oversee the purchase of key software tools to support development and
                    business
                    process improvements, and I evaluate cost estimates provided by external suppliers and contractors,
                    approving
                    their proposed full-time efforts when necessary.
                </p>

                <h3>DevOps Cloud Engineer · Client-Facing Role</h3>
                <p>
                    In a more client-facing role, I represent my team directly with the customer on all cloud-related
                    topics. I
                    participate in daily discussions with stakeholders, provide architectural input for new projects,
                    and lead
                    third-party vendors using a shared Jira board for coordination. This role has also introduced a
                    managerial
                    dimension to my responsibilities.
                </p>

                <h3>DevOps Cloud Engineer · Cloud Migration & Automation</h3>
                <p>
                    During the cloud migration phase, I was responsible for moving applications from Google Cloud
                    Platform to AWS.
                    My work focused on developing automation pipelines using Infrastructure as Code to implement both
                    architectures
                    and applications efficiently and securely.
                </p>

                <h3>AWS Operations Support</h3>
                <p>
                    I started my journey by supporting operational teams, resolving service tickets, and monitoring
                    system logs to
                    quickly detect and troubleshoot issues. This helped ensure reliability, performance, and continuity
                    of service
                    for all environments involved.
